## Description
Locate-This is a mobile first application in which users can pin interesting or important locations onto a map. Users have their own personal map in which they can populate with locations associated with their favorite hiking trails, cool sites, or any point of interest. This app leverages the robust mapbox library as well as the geolocation API. Users can pull their current coordinates, thanks to geolocator, or enter custom latitude and longitude. That way users don’t need to be physically present to upload and view a known location.
